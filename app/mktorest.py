# Figure out how to fix the POST calls that take multipart files
# Do more elegant error handling and document the exceptions
# Be more consistent with folder_id vs. folder
# Double check all the call URLs
# Test if you can include a cookie value in create/update and Marketo will automatically merge the activities
# Explicitly cast all variables to protect against type errors at runtime
# Refactor API calls into similar groups. E.G. create/update leads an opps is duplicated code. So are opp and opp role.
# Possibly eliminate documentation redundancies

# Incomplete calls
